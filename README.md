Story of Ava is a rhythm based shooter made using Unity. It is a concept I'd been thinking about for a while and will be working on it further.
Basically, I wanted to make a side-scrolling shooter with some elements of music. I converged down to the idea where you have to shoot your bullets to a beat at a set BPM - just like in Bullets Per Minute.
You won't get points if you kill enemies but shoot bullets out of rhythm.

Additionally, I wanted to have 3D elements, while maintaining a pixel art effect for the character. What I envisioned this as is Ava moving 'in and out' of the screen.
Instead of 3D modeling the character and dealing with the z-axis, what I thought would be simpler to do is scale her up and down in size, and have her only interact with objects of different sizes when she is at 
particular different sizes.
This helped give the illusion of her moving in and out of the screen.

If you want a comprehensive report, email me at padheeabhishek5@gmail.com. On this repository, I'm only sharing the core functionality of rhythm detection and scaling her in and out.
